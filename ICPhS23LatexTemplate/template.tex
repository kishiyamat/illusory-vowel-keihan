\begin{abstract}
This study investigated how phoneme perception models should incorporate allophones, leveraging dialectical differences among Japanese. It has been reported that listeners of a language that disallows consonant clusters insert epenthetic vowels, or illusory vowels, to repair illegal consonant clusters, thus, for example, perceiving VCCV as VCVCV. In addition to the roles of phonotactic constraints and acoustic cues, recent studies have indicated that allophones, such as devoiced vowels in the Tokyo dialect, also facilitate perceptual epenthesis. We compared the discrimination accuracies of VCCV and VCVCV perception of Tokyo-dialect speakers to those of Kansai-dialect speakers, who are reported to devoice vowels less frequently. Both Tokyo and Kansai speakers perceived illusory vowels to the same degree, indicating that illusory vowels were perceived even by speakers without devoicing. Furthermore, the results suggest that discriminative models other than probabilistic models assuming an auditory realization distribution can be psychologically valid.
