## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

model <- stan_glm(
  formula = extra ~ group,
  data = sleep,
  prior = normal(0, 3, autoscale = FALSE),
  chains = 10, iter = 5000, warmup = 1000
)
```

```{r}
model
```


```{r}
My_first_BF <- bayesfactor_parameters(model, null = c(-1, 1))
My_first_BF
```

```{r}
library(see)
plot(My_first_BF)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
